# Online Food Ordering System

## Project Description
The aim of our project is to allow users to order food easily. In order to achieve this goal, I started by creating a database using MySQL. Once we created these tables, I inserted some values to them that would serve as the base of our operations. Then, I started working on Python code which would allow the user to enter specified information in order to make an order or add, update, and delete certain things. Finally, when the change is done it changes on the database as well.

## ER Diagram
ER Diagram helped me visualize and find connections between objects and concepts to build and structure databases of different industries.

## DB Schema
A database schema is a blueprint of the logical layout of a database, outlining how data is organized and structured. It describes various objects within the database, such as tables, columns, views, indexes, and stored procedures.

## UI User's Manual
In order to give and order, give an user ID that exists within the database (1-9) otherwise it will give you a message that tells you that it does not exist. Then give an order ID that exists (1-6) once again if you enter one that does not exist it will give an error message. Lastly, enter the amount you want. Bon appetit!

In order to use add update and delete functions simply write things the way you wish only constraint is to make sure enter correct value type for example make sure to use an integer for UserID.
